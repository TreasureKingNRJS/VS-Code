<p style="color: rgb(23, 182, 150);background-color: indigo;" >Treasure (from Latin: thesaurus from Greek language θησαυρός thēsauros, "treasure store")[2][3] is a concentration of wealth — often originating from ancient history — that is considered lost and/or forgotten until rediscovered. Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure, such as in the British Treasure Act 1996.<br><br>

    The phrase "blood and treasure" has been used to refer to the human and monetary costs associated with massive endeavours such as war that expend both.[4]<br><br>
    
    Searching for hidden treasure is a common theme in legend; treasure hunters do exist, and can seek lost wealth for a living.<br><br></p>
